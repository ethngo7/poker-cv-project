# poker-cv-project

this is a work-in-progress as of July 13, 2025... 
Repository work is very rough drafted.

this is close to finished as of July 23, 2025... 
I have created the Streamlit deployment here: [https://ethanspokercvproject.streamlit.app/](https://poker-cv-project-bipfjg8fy7hcp9q3uebsk9.streamlit.app/)



Instructions:
1. Include a decent image of a poker board (clear and aligned is preferred) like the my picture below
2. Type in your hole cards
3. Analyze
4. (Optional - edit anything else: # of players, amount to call, etc.)
